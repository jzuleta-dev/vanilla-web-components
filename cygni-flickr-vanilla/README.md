Cygni flickr app

##

Objective

The assignement is to create photo gallery that uses the public API from flickr to retrieve and display images on a web page.
​
All _JavaScript_ should be written with [VanillaJS](http://vanilla-js.com/). **This means that no frameworks or libraries are allowed**.
​
Same goes for _HTML/CSS_. Everything should be written from scratch, that is, no frameworks are allowed.

## System pre-requisites

- Node (v10+) and npm installed.

## Setup

- Enter into the container folder.
- Type `npm install`
- For runnning the application you have to do `npm start`

## Requirements.

- Be responsive from mobile and up. ☑️
- Fill 100% of it's container. ☑️
- Be independent of content outside it's container. ☑️
- Not affect other elements on the page. ☑️
- Give user feedback when loading or if the API is unresponsive. ☑️ (When the API is not responding a template with an error could be injected on the DOM)
- Work in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Edge.☑
  ​

## Example features (optional)

- Endless scroll ☑️
- Search functionality. ☑️

## Developer notes

I took an approach for this problem using web components along with classes which was something that I never worked in the past, I found it quite useful also to reassure knowledge and have a deeper understading on how frameworks/libraries work under the hood.
